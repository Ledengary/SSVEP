# SSVEP
Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP)

In this notebook, I have implemented different fundamental algorithms to detect SSVEP frequencies. The dataset I used contains brainwaves of subjects looking at flashing lights with 13, 21, and 17 frequencies. 

- **Implemented algorithms:**
	- PSDA
	- CCA
	- MSI
	- sCCA
	- FoCCA
	- FBCCA
	- ML + CCA
